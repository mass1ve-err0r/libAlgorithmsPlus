# libAlgorithmsPlus
> Java 8 | Keepin' it **O(n)**-point

## Prelude
`libAlgorithmsPlus` is basically my own algorithms library. I got tired of copy-pasting between my projects and forgettig where I used an algo, this is my solution for aforementioned laziness.

It's a combination of my LeetCode solutions, things I picked up along the way and optimized or simply algos which I use frequently.

My goal was and still is to keep complexity near `O(n)` (linear complexity).

## Structure
The library is basically split into two parts as of now:
- `Search`
	- Searching / Finding algorithms
- `Calculate`
	- Generators / Builders

Each _"category"_ can operate on arrays or strings, methods may vary in their implementation as it's dependent on what I personally need / use.

Documentation will be fledged out at a later stage.
